# BabyGoRound

BabyGoRound supports families living in poverty, single parents, refugees, and mothers living in homeless shelters by giving them access to essential supplies. Their volunteers have one-on-one appointments with families to select the items they need. They anticipate assisting close to 900 families per year. 

This web app was developed as a part of the VanHacks 2018 Hackathon.

The app we built has two different dashboard views. The agency dashboard where a social worker working for the agency can see all the clients, add new clients and view other staff members or the agency profile. The client once created will be added to a clients list which a volunteer can login to approve. The volunteer dashboard has stats listed on it to indicate the number of families helped this month, number of hours volunteered and number of items donated. The volunteers can look up agencies, clients and manage their inventory from their dashboard.
